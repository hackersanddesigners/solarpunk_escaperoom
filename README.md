# Solarpunk Escaperoom

This is a variation on the solarpunk workshop where we made an escape room. The theme drifted from SolarPunk a bit, the partcipants chose their own theme (escaping from an submarine that was running out of oxygen). In future versions it would be great to facilitate storytelling about solarpunk futures instead. Here you find the documentation of the one-week workshop we did in 2023 with 15 year old high-schoolers (materials in Dutch, sowwy)

## Introduction

Is all the internet global? Can I create my own internet? How much power does it consume? Is it bad for the environment? At
Hackers & Designers we conduct experiments to find out what a sustainable internet of the future could look like. Do you want
join us? We're going to create portable Wi-Fi networks to hide digital clues somewhere in school. After making the
game, of course we go hunting and try to find the clues with our mobile phones!

What can you expect? Participants learn how to design a game and create mini websites using HTML and CSS. We're going portable Wi-Fi modules
can program that we use to create the game.

## Fileguide

In the files you can find the week's program outline, example code, and some code participants made. Other than in the other workshops, the participants made slightly more complex websites that includes some scripting. This allowed them to ask users for input (e.g. a code) that they could verify before sending user to a next page.
